staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10000100=Now that I think about it, I haven't properly introduced myself.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10000200=I'm the mayor of this little town.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10001300=Oh, is that your ^c:d03e37;Farm Registration Letter^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10001400=How nice! Let me just take that off you for filing.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10001500=In return, you get your ^c:d03e37;license^c:pop; and some very handy items!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10001600=Do you want to turn in your ^c:d03e37;Registration Letter^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10001700=Yes, please!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10001800=No, not just yet
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10001900=Marvellous! Here is your ^c:d03e37;license^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002000=We also have a few extras for you.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002100=We're all looking forward to seeing the farm revitalised!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002200=As you wish!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002300=You can still turn it in later if you change your mind!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002400=I imagine I'll be seeing you quite often!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002500=Now that you're a fully licensed farmer...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002600=We can finally get those stray ^c:d03e37;cattle^c:pop; off our hands!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002700=But before we can do that, you need to build a ^c:1486b0;barn^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002800=I'm not really sure I'm the best person to teach you these things.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002900=I'd suggest you go see ^c:1486b0;{0-mech_name}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003000=She'll help you out with all the parts you need.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003100=You'll probably find her hanging out around the ^c:1486b0;building store^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003150=If not, your map might be able to help you locate her.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003200=Come and see me once it's all done and we'll get you some ^c:d03e37;cows^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003300=How are you faring at building that ^c:1486b0;barn^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003400=^c:1486b0;{0-mech_name}^c:pop; should be able to help you out!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003500=She's usually hanging out around the ^c:1486b0;building store^c:pop; during the day.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003800=I've been hearing about the fabulous new ^c:1486b0;barn^c:pop; you built!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003900=Sounds like everything is in order.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004000=Here are the few ^c:d03e37;cows^c:pop; we managed to round up.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004100=They all ran away when the previous owner left.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004200=Good luck!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004300=By the way, we've been looking for good builders for a long time.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004400=Sometimes we get notices from people who want to move in here.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004500=Before that, they need a house to live in.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004600=Given your impressive work on the ^c:1486b0;barn^c:pop;, we'd love your help!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004700=Come check in with me every once in a while!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004710=New requests usually come in every week or so.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004720=In the meantime, it might be a good idea to get to know everyone!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004730=There's bound to be someone looking for assistance.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004740=I know ^c:1486b0;{0-caith_name}^c:pop; has been moping around quite a bit ever since she arrived...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004750=She's bound to have a task for you.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004760=If that doesn't appeal, you can always head off exploring or kick back and look after the farm!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004770=It's all up to you really! We just want to see what you make of the place!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004800=Looks like someone new wants to move in!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004900=Stick this ^c:d03e37;postbox^c:pop; somewhere and use it to build a house!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10005000=Once it's built, they'll move in the next day!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10005100=Hmm...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10005200=What happened to your ^c:d03e37;{0-ttm}^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10005300=Make sure you use it to build our future resident a home!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10005350=Oh, before I forget, I recently managed to get post delivered to the town!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10005400=Ah ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! Just the person I wanted to see!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10005500=It's taken years of negotiation, but I've finally done it!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10005600=As of today, the postal service is adding us to their deliveries.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10005700=You need to set up this ^c:d03e37;Postbox^c:pop; to access your mail!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10005800=You could be getting mail already!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10005900=Excellent work ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10006000=Now that their new home is complete, a new villager should move in within a day or two!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10006100=I'm sure they'll have something special for you when they arrive!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10006200=Ah, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! As the mayor of this town, I say this with a heavy heart.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10006300=I am preparing to flee the town. I suggest you do the same.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10006400=With that...creature prowling the forests, I can think of no other recourse.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10006500=Ah, is that a letter from ^c:1486b0;Riah^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10006600=Let me just take that off your hands.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10006700=Yes... I see... So this is about the siblings again...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10006800=She came to ^c:1486b0;Staxel^c:pop; with one of them, you know.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10006900=They were... Oh! I'm rambling again. Terribly sorry!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10007000=^c:1486b0;Riah^c:pop; wanted you to have a few things from her account.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10007100=Allow me to have them mailed to you.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10007200=Do come by again if you'd like to chat!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10007300=Rabbits? From how many years ago?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10007400=Sorry ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, I'm afraid we don't keep those kinds of records.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10007500=My memory is not quite what it used to be either...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10007600=What can I help you with today, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10007700=Is this about ^c:1486b0;Cecile's^c:pop; ^c:1486b0;lab^c:pop; again?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10007800=I must admit to having serious doubts about the whole thing.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10007900=A scientific lab? Here? With ^c:1486b0;Cecile's^c:pop; in charge?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10008000=It sounds like a recipe for disaster.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10008100=But...if you're going to be keeping an eye on her, we might just survive.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10008200=And we could certainly use the money her discoveries might bring in...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10008300=I suppose, for now, I can allow it on the condition that it be small and safely constructed.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10008400=I trust you to see to the latter. I'll be holding you personally responsible!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10008500=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10008600=I must admit to being somewhat disappointed, though I have come to realise it was probably not your fault.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10008700=But this cannot be allowed to go on. I'm sure you understand.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10008800=We need to insure the town against future damages!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10008900=If we could find a ^c:1486b0;merchant^c:pop; willing to sell us insurance, that would do the trick.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10009000=My paperwork has been piling up quite a bit of late so I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to go on my behalf.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10009100=You'll find a few of them around the ^c:1486b0;town square^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10009200=Ah, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;. Were you successful?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10009300=Hmm...this does appear to be genuine. I'll reimburse you the upfront payment.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10009400=This is wonderful news for the town! Now ^c:1486b0;Cecile^c:pop; is free to blow up anything she likes!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10009500=Of course, I must warn you on principle not to cause any damage...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10009600=But...don't be too careful...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10009700=I eagerly await word of your success!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10009800=I'm certain at least one of the ^c:1486b0;merchants^c:pop; will be willing to cooperate...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10009900=This is too much, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10010000=Even with insurance, I cannot sit by and allow a monster to roam the town!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10010100=You have to do something about it. It certainly can't stay here.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10010200=Please inform ^c:1486b0;Cecile^c:pop; that if she does not get rid of it, she will be the one leaving.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10010300=A note you say? Tell me it was not sent by ^c:1486b0;Oscar^c:pop;...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10010400=Always with these notes... I understand that it's expensive to send by post...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10010500=But why do they never come to me in person?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10010600=So ^c:1486b0;Oscar^c:pop; believes we have a vandal?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10010700=I must say, with the state the town's been in recently, I was beginning to worry he was getting too old...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10010800=But a vandal...? Now that makes far more sense.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10010900=Let ^c:1486b0;Oscar^c:pop; know that the message was received, would you?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10011000=I'd tell him myself, but...I think I'd rather not!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10011100=Listen, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;. I'm sorry you were dragged into all of this.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10011200=^c:1486b0;Oscar^c:pop; can be...a challenge sometimes.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10011300=The next election isn't even coming up for another year!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10011400=But I suppose I should at least compensate you for all this nonsense somehow...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10011500=I suspect it's not nearly adequate, but it's all I can personally offer right now.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10011600=I trust you'll vote for me next year!
