staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10002700=I think there were ^c:1486b0;emperor butterflies^c:pop; around here too.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10002800=There could be more, but I think those are the important ones.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10002900=...^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;?
